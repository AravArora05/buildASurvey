Project: Build A Survey Form

Description: Part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification curriculum, this project involves creating a responsive survey form using HTML and CSS.

Features:
Input fields for name, email, number, dropdown options, radio options, and checkbox options.
Responsive layout adapting to various screen sizes.

Remarks: Could have done a better job overall with it being responsive for all devices. This was our first project, but I'm excited to see where else I can improve on in future endeavors. I tried to mantain good spacing, but
it seems a bit unbalanced at some spots.
